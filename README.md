## About The Project

[Tim Hjersted's](https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?members/tim-hjersted.57302/) adventure map The Story of Red Cloud is beloved by many, but it's now nearing a decade old. Many newer players of Terraria have never even heard of it, so we'd like to bring it back into the public eye by porting the mod to TModLoader.

We're looking to do a full transfer of the original mod, which includes:

* Over 400 custom items, weapons, and armor
* 22 new bosses
* Tons of new enemies
* A completely handmade map, with 13 dungeons and tons of secrets


## Roadmap

The current plan has us finish the transfer of the mod to TModLoader. Once that's done, we'll be taking community feedback on our next step. The goal is to have the custom map updated and to expand on the original mod with custom content and support for new vanilla features.


## Contributing

Contributors are always welcome and greatly appreciated! We are always in need of extra programmers and sprite artists, and if you're an experienced Terraria builder, we may need your help too! If you'd like to help, the best way to get in touch is directly through Github via pull requests or in our Discord server.

Special thanks to Linklight2 for their large porting effort, and to Maxisi for their contributions to (and providing us with) Linklight2's most recent build.
