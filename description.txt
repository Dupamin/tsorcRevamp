GAME MANUAL:
--------------------------------------------
*Create a new character named Red Cloud.

*Adventure Mode should stay checked in the TSORC mod config options to play with the custom map.

*Read signs in the order you come to them.

*Read all item tool-tips for hints and game clues, especially mod items.

*Don't move vanilla NPC's like the Wizard, Mechanic or Goblin Tinkerer until you've found them in game. Modded NPCs may be moved.

*On death, you will drop all your Dark Souls and have one chance to recover them. For a more forgiving experience, you can turn this off in the mod's Config options.

*Multiplayer is currently being beta-tested and is not yet in a polished state. If you'd like to try it out and help with testing, post any issues you find under #bug-reports. Thanks. The map supports up to 3 players. Class diversity recommended.
