The Story of Red Cloud's Dark Souls mod, transferred to TModLoader and filled with new features.

This is a beta release meant for testing. It does not represent the final version of the mod.

This release includes (approximately) all of the items from the original mod, in as close to their original state as possible. There are also some NPCs and several new additions.
