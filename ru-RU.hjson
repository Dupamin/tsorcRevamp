					Debug Item used for restoring corrupted maps. Can cause minimap corruption if you are not trying to do that!!

					2) Leave the world
					3) Rejoin the world with the character you want to have a restored minimap
					4) Delete this item and never use it again
					Warnings:
					This will only work for one character per world. Attempting to restore a second character's minimap will break the minimap of the first.
					This will reset your spawn to the world spawn next time you load the map. This is expected.
					This works by temporarily editing your World ID to trick Terraria into recognizing your old minimap as correct.
					This is completely unteseted with other mods. Tred very lightly.
					If you have entered other copies of the the custom map on this character since the update, there is a nonzero chance your minimap was overwritten
					If so it will not be recoverable.
