The Story of Red Cloud is a massive Dark Souls-inspired adventure built inside the world of Terraria using a custom map, mod and companion soundtrack. Your 1-4 player journey will span 18 dungeons spread across an expansive, hand-crafted open world, offering a 20 to 30+ hr experience for a first playthrough.

✅ The Custom Map will load automatically when you reach the Select World screen. To create a fresh or updated map, click New on the World screen.

✅ TOP FEATURES
------------------------------------------
*Explore a vast, interconnected and richly illustrated world, developed over the span of 4 years
*Companion Soundtrack with 59 songs! (Dark Souls, Elden Ring and Zelda fans will love it)
*42 bosses (17 vanilla plus 25 mod bosses)
*100+ new NPCS including 8 friendly NPCs

⚠️ PROJECT STATUS: BETA
------------------------------------------
The game is fairly polished up to the end of the main story (defeating Attraidies). Development is currently focused on balancing and revamping the sizeable post-Attraidies content, especially the bosses. We recommend waiting to play this third chapter when we're out of beta, unless you'd like to be a part of the journey to 1.0. 
The mod has been made fully translatable through localization files, if you're interested in making it more accessible to your fellow speakers, please join the discord and ask MarfMaster for details.

⚠️ GAME MANUAL:
------------------------------------------
*Create a new character named Red Cloud (for multiplayer, everyone should use a different name)

*Read signs in the order you come to them 

*Read all mod item tool-tips for hints and important game clues. Also look for "Dark Souls Crafting Material" on items to discover craftable mod content.

*On death, you will drop all your Dark Souls and have one chance to recover them. For a more forgiving experience, you can turn this off in the mod's Config options.

*The new dodge roll action with i-frames is an essential part of TSORC. It can be bound to any key in TModLoader's controller settings, under the mod section. (Left Alt by default. Left Shift is also recommended, with Auto Select bound to Left Alt.)

*Adventure Mode should stay checked in the TSORC mod config options to play with the custom map.

*Multiplayer is supported for 4 players. Class diversity recommended. Post issues you find under #bug-reports. Thanks!
