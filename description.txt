The Story of Red Cloud is a massive Dark Souls-inspired adventure built inside the world of Terraria using a custom map, mod and companion soundtrack. Your 1-4 player journey will span 17 dungeons spread across an expansive, hand-crafted open world, offering a 20 to 30+ hr experience for a first playthrough.

- The Custom Map will load automatically when you reach the Select World screen. To create a fresh or updated map, click New on the World screen.

- To download TSORC's Music Mod, click the text prompt you'll see on TML's main menu after enabling this mod.


TOP FEATURES
*Explore a vast, interconnected and richly illustrated world, developed over the span of 4 years
*Companion Soundtrack with 59 songs! (Dark Souls, Elden Ring and Zelda fans will love it)
*42 bosses (17 vanilla plus 25 mod bosses)
*100+ new NPCS including 8 friendly NPCs
*Over 700 new mod items, weapons, and armors, both original and remixed from two dozen of the best classic mods from the community
*Dark Souls game mechanics, including bonfire save points and the dodge roll (bound to Left Alt by default)
*The mod enforces old school adventure map rules, so if you can do it, it's okay to do it!



PROJECT STATUS: BETA
The game is fairly polished up to the end of the main story (defeating Attraidies). Development is currently focused on balancing and revamping the sizeable post-Attraidies content, especially the bosses. We recommend waiting to play this third chapter when we're out of beta, unless you'd like to be a part of the journey to 1.0.

GAME MANUAL:
------------------------------------------
*Create a new character named Red Cloud (for multiplayer, everyone should use a different name)

*Read signs in the order you come to them 

*Read all mod item tool-tips for hints and important game clues

*On death, you will drop all your Dark Souls and have one chance to recover them. For a more forgiving experience, you can turn this off in the mod's Config options.

*The new dodge roll action with i-frames is an essential part of TSORC. It can be bound to any key in TModLoader's controller settings, under the mod section. (Left Alt by default. Left Shift also recommended.)

*Adventure Mode should stay checked in the TSORC mod config options to play with the custom map.

*Multiplayer is supported for 4 players. Class diversity recommended. Post issues you find under #bug-reports. Thanks!
